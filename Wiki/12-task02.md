# Object Exercise 2
  
How to access and change the properties of an object.


Open file named **task02.js**. Inside it, write your code in a function and then finally export it.

Your work is to create a function with one argument: object. You have to use for loop to push every even element of the array fibonnaci in the new array and return the 
result variable.


* Use var to create a new variable and assign it an empty array
* Use for loop and write conditions
* Use push method and access even elements of array fibonnaci from the object
* Return the variable with resulting array


Given below is the format of the object which will be passed as the argument.

```js
var nestedData = {
  innerData: {
    order: [],
    snacks: [],
    numberData: {
        primeNumbers: [],
        fibonnaci: []
    },
    
  }
}
```

Hint:

- Use var to create a new variable and assign it an empty array
- Use for loop and write conditions
- Use push method and access even elements of array fibonnaci from the object
- Return the variable with resulting array
