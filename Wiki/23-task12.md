# Object Exercise 12

Write a JS program that returns an object which has some specific string manipulation functions.

Open file named **task12.js**. Inside it, write your code in a function and then finally export it.
The function should have an object which has four key-value pairs.
These are :  
key `up` whose value has a function that takes a string and returns it after converting it into uppercase,  
key `low` whose value has a function that takes a string and returns it after converting it into lowercase,  
key `len` whose value has a function that takes a string and returns its length and  
key `sta` whose value has a function that takes a string, converts it into an array of characters and returns it.

Return this object and also print the result if "alPhA" is passed as arguments to all these functions.

Hint:

- Create the object and make four key-value pairs
- Define every function
- Return the object
