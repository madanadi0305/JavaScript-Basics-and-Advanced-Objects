# Object Exercise 1

How to access and change the properties of an object.


Open file named **task01.js**. Inside it, write your code in a function and then finally export it.

Your work is to create a function with one argument: object. You have to use for loop to push each element of the array primeNumbers in the new array and return result variable.


* Use push method and access array primeNumber from the object
* Return the variable with resulting array


Given below is the format of the object which will be passed as the parameter, access the property primeNumbers.


```js
var obj = {
  types: {
    binary: [],
    decimal: [],
    numberData: {
        primeNumbers: [1,2,3,4,5],
        fibonnaci: []
    }
   
  }
}
```

```js
output should be [1,2,3,4,5]
```


Hint:

- Use push method and access array primeNumber from the object
- Return the variable with resulting array
