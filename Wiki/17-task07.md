# Object Exercise 7

How to work with the properties of an object.

Open file named **task07.js**. Inside it, write your code in a function and then finally export it.

Given below is an array of objects stored in variable personnel. The object contains data around the persons such as id,
name, pilotingScore, shootingScore and whether he is a ForceUser or not. Your work is to create a function with one argument an object.
You have to calculate the total score
(pilotingScore + shootingScore) of all those objects where the value of isForceUser is true.
Return the resulting value in an output variable

Given below is the format of the object which will be passed as the argument.

```js
var personnel = [
  {
    id: 5,
    name: "Luke Skywalker",
    pilotingScore: 98,
    shootingScore: 56,
    isForceUser: true
  },
  {
    id: 82,
    name: "Sabine Wren",
    pilotingScore: 73,
    shootingScore: 99,
    isForceUser: false
  }
];
```
