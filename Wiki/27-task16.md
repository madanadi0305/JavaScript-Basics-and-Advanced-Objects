# Object Exercise 16

Write a JS program to check how many combinations are possible for a person to reach the topmost level.

Open file named **task16.js**. Inside it, write your code in a function and then finally export it.
The function must take an argument which is an object. The object is of the following form:

```js
ob1 = {
  steps: 4,
  ability: [1, 3]
};
```

The `steps` key denotes the number of levels. In this example, there are 4 steps like following:

```
        _   level 4
      _|    level 3
    _|      level 2
  _|        level 1
_|          level 0

```

The `ability` key denotes how many steps a person is allowed to take at a time. In this example, the person can take only
 1 or 3 steps at a time. Meaning, the person can go 1 level up or directly 3 level up at a time.  
Your task is to find out and return in how many ways the person can go to the topmost level.

For this example, there is a combination of three ways:

- level 0 -> level 1 -> level 2 -> level 3 -> level 4
- level 0 -> level 1 -> level 4
- level 0 -> level 3 -> level 4

So the output will be `3`

Hint:

- Create the function
- Count how many ways are possible using recursion
- Return the answer
