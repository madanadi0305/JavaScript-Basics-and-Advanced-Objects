# Object Exercise 6

How to work with properties of an object

Open file named **task06.js**. Inside it, write your code in a function and then finally export it.

Given below is an array of objects stored in variable arr. Your work is to create
a function with one argument an object. You have to return an object with 2 properties, 

- 1st property named **prop1** contains an array that contains all the non-empty elements of 
array arr with value not equal to null, NaN, 'undefined' and 0. 

- 2nd property named **prop2** contains the `number` of elements from array arr 
which were not included in the first property. 
Copy and Use this object in your code and return the resulting object in an output variable

Given below is the format of the object which will be passed as the argument.

```js
var arr = [
  { id: 15 },
  { id: -1 },
  { id: 0 },
  { id: 3 },
  { id: 12.2 },
  {},
  { id: null },
  { id: NaN },
  { id: "undefined" }
];
```

Hint:

- Create new variables and assign values
- Create a function with one parameter and use if-else to filter elements from array arr
- Create a new object and add properties
- Return the resulting object in the output variable
