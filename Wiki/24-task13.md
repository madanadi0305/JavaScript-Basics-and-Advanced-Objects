# Object Exercise 13

Write a JS program that returns an object which has some specific functions to print patterns.

Open file named **task13.js**. Inside it, write your code in a function and then finally export it.
The function must contain an object which has two key-value pairs.
These are :  
key `pyramid` whose value has a function which takes two arguments x,y: x is a positive integer and y is character. This function returns a pyramid pattern of the passed character of length x.  
key `diamond` whose value has a function which takes two arguments x,y: x is a positive integer and y is character. This function returns a diamond pattern of the passed character of length x.

Return this object.

If `(3,"*")` is passed as arguments to this function, then  
pyramid returns:

```
  *
 ***
*****
```

and diamond returns:

```
  *
 * *
* * *
* * *
 * *
  *
```

Hint:

- Create the object and make two key-value pairs
- Define the functions
- Return the object
